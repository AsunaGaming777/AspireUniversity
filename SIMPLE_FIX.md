# ✅ DONE - Just Push and Deploy

I've fixed everything. You don't need to change anything in the Netlify dashboard.

## What to Do:

1. **Commit and push** all the files I changed
2. **Go to Netlify** → Click "Deploys" tab
3. **Click "Trigger deploy"** → "Clear cache and deploy site"
4. **Done!**

The `netlify.toml` file will tell Netlify to use pnpm automatically.

## If It Still Fails:

**Switch to Railway** - it's way easier and handles pnpm better:
1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repo
5. Done - it auto-detects everything

Railway is better for monorepos anyway. Want me to help you switch?
